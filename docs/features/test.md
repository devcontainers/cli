# Testing Dev Container Features

A built-in testing framework for Features is currently under active development.  This command aims to make it easy to iterate on [self-authored Features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features-distribution/).

This command utilizes the CLI's `build` and `exec` commands to test Features in your local source tree.  The command will look at the `target` path for mirrored `src` and `test` directories ([example](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).  Without any additional arguments, the `test` command will auto-generate a test for each Feature (pulling the source code directly from `src/<FEATURE>`), and exec `test/<FEATURE>/test.sh` inside of the running container.  

For the test to pass, the container must (1) build and start successfully, and (2) execute the `test.sh` with a success (zero) exit code.  Note that auto-generated tests will execute the given Feature
with default options.

Additonally, 'scenarios' can be defined for each Feature to test more complicated cases (ie: Passing options to tests, testing >1 Feature together, etc.).  More information on [writing scenarios can be found below](#scenarios).

The source code can of the sub-command is [here](../../src/spec-node/featuresCLI/test.ts). An example of the command being used in CI can be [found in the `devcontainers/features-template` repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/feature-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yaml) and the [`devcontainers/features` repo](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).

```

## Scenarios 

Scenarios are an additional mode that augments the auto-generated test (that is asserted with the `test/<FEATURE>/test.sh` script).  

Scenarios are snippets of `devcontainer.json` configuration.  The scenario is a JSON object, where the key is the test name, and the object is a `devcontainer.json`.

> I'll use the [`oryx` Feature](https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/2d89dc301ed834d74b07350c7d8567eee78f966d/test/oryx) as an example if you'd like a live code sample.

The following `scenarios.json` defines a single test scenario named `install_dotnet_and_oryx`.  The scenario will install the `dotnet` and `oryx` Features in the target repo with the provided options. 


##### test/oryx/scenarios.json
```json
{
    "install_dotnet_and_oryx": {
        "image": "ubuntu:focal",
        "features": {
            "dotnet": {
                "version": "6",
                "installUsingApt": "false"
            },
            "oryx": {}
        }
    }
}
```

The test command will build a container with the config above, and then look for a `.sh` test file with the same name.  The test will pass if the container builds successfully
and the `install_dotnet_and_oryx.sh` shell script exits will a successful exit code (0).

##### test/install_dotnet_and_oryx.sh
```
#!/bin/bash

set -e

# Optional: Import test library
source dev-container-features-test-lib

check "Oryx version" oryx --version
check "Dotnet is not removed if it is not installed by the Oryx Feature" dotnet --version

# Install platforms with oryx build tool
check "oryx-install-dotnet-2.1" oryx prep --skip-detection --platforms-and-versions dotnet=2.1.30
check "dotnet-2-installed-by-oryx" ls /opt/dotnet/ | grep 2.1

....
....

# Replicates Oryx's behavior for universal image
mkdir -p /opt/oryx
echo "vso-focal" >> /opt/oryx/.imagetype

mkdir -p /opt/dotnet/lts
cp -R /usr/local/dotnet/current/dotnet /opt/dotnet/lts
cp -R /usr/local/dotnet/current/LICENSE.txt /opt/dotnet/lts
cp -R /usr/local/dotnet/current/ThirdPartyNotices.txt /opt/dotnet/lts

....
....

# Report result
reportResults
```

The flags `--global-scenarios-only`, `--skip-scenarios`, and `--skip-autogenerated` can be passed to run a subset of tests.


### Global Scenarios

The `test/_global` directory is a special directory that holds scenario tests not tied to a specific Feature. This directory is useful for scenarios that broadly tests several Features in a given repository.

The `--global-scenarios-only` can be passed to only run the global scenarios.


## dev-container-features-test-lib

The `dev-container-features-test-lib` is convenience helper [defined in the CLI](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/blob/1910ca41015c627b884ddd69ebc52d1e8cdd8cf0/src/spec-node/featuresCLI/utils.ts#L59).  This shell script can be sourced in any shell script test file when running the `devcontainer features test` command, **although it is not required**.

#### `check <LABEL> <cmd>`
Description: Executes `cmd` and prints success/failed depending on exit code (0 === success) of `cmd`.
Note: Do not use quotes for cmd as there is no such executable as e.g. "python3 --version".
Example: `check "python is available" python3 --version`

#### `checkMultiple <LABEL> <MINIMUMPASSED> <cmd1> [cmd2] [cmd3] ...`
Description: Executes all provided commands succeeds if the number of `cmdX` is greater than `$MINIMUMPASSED`
Note: Do not use quotes for cmd as there is no such executable as e.g. "python3 --version".

##### reportResults
Prints results of check and checkMultiple
